# About Me

I’m a data analyst with a deep curiosity for uncovering insights that drive better decision-making. Whether I’m working with SQL, Python, R, or visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, my goal is to transform complex data into clear, actionable solutions. I’ve gained experience across various industries, from retail management to energy solutions, building dashboards and identifying trends that help teams operate more efficiently. I’m always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow, and expand my skills.

At CAMI Energy, I had the chance to implement risk management strategies and create analytical tools that optimized client performance. My favorite part of the job is communicating insights in a way that everyone can understand, regardless of their technical background. Data isn’t just numbers to me—it’s the key to telling a compelling story that can make a real impact.

Outside of work, I'm a proud cat mom who enjoys solving puzzles, watching true crime shows (I’m always on the lookout for the next big mystery!), and getting lost in a good book. In my free time, you can usually find me by the water fishing or cheering on my brother at his baseball games. I love balancing my analytical mindset with these personal passions, always eager to learn, explore, and challenge myself in new ways.
